# The OT Homelab: Build Your OT Infrastructure in Minutes, Not Months

Tired of waiting months for complex, resource-intensive OT projects to deliver results?  
As an end-user who's been there, I discovered a better way.  
As someone who's implemented OT solutions from the end-user side, I've learned a practical approach that cuts through the complexity.

What if you could build and test a complete OT infrastructure using equipment you already have, and see real value using minimal resources?

## What

**Building a complete OT infrastructure using a homelab.**  
Leveraging Linux Ubuntu, Docker, Portainer, and GitHub, you can set this up on:

- An old or new PC/laptop at home âœ…
- A Linux VM in your IT/OT server infrastructure âœ… 

---

## Why

You should be able to run a pilot with minimal resources and deliver value within 12 to 16 weeks.  
Technology should not be the bottleneck in your Digital Transformation (DT) journey.

Understanding how to leverage Linux and Docker in OT are invaluable skills for your future.

Experimenting at home lets you:

- Test software in a safe environment before introducing it to production  
- Filter out ineffective solutions early  
- Speed up future pilot deployments  

---

## How

**Land & Expand â†’** Install and run your software for free, in no time.  

No sales calls. No quotes. Whether the software is free or comes with a trial license, you should be able to prove the concept first,  
then scale to a production-grade solution.

## The Tech Stack

The goal is to build a tech stack as the foundation for your Digital Transformation strategy.  
We need to connect, collect, store, visualize, and analyze data effectively.

Putting proof to the pudding, I will show you that we can deploy a full OT stack within minutes.  
We will use **Linux Ubuntu**, **Portainer**, **Docker**, and **GitHub**.

### Applications to run in Docker containers:

- **Ignition** (IIOT platform) with Cirrus Link modules (MQTT)  
- **HiveMQ** (MQTT broker)  
- **Postgres** (Database)  
- **PgAdmin** (Database management)  

### Bonus

- **Glances** (System Monitoring)  
- **Grafana** (Data Analytics)  

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: For simplicity, I use hard-coded usernames/passwords and Docker volumes, but I recommend using environment variables and persistent data on the host.

## Resources & Special Thanks

ðŸ™Œ Big thanks to the people who made my continuous learning journey possible:

- Walker Reynolds  
- Mastermind at 4.0 Solutions  
- The I4.0 Discord Community  
- Ignition University  
- UMH blog  
- HiveMQ blog  
- â€¦and many others pushing the boundaries in OT & IT  

My goal is to help fellow OT professionals bypass months of planning and procurement to start seeing real results within weeks.  
This homelab approach has transformed how I implement OT solutions, and I'm excited to share these practical methods with you.

**What are your experiences?**  
I'll plan to share detailed step-by-step tutorials in future posts.  
Comment below if there's a specific aspect you'd like me to cover first!
